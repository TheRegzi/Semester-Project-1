![Website image](assets/website-image.JPG)

This website is my submission for Semester Project 1 at my Front-end Development studies at Noroff Vocational School.

## Description

This project aims to design and develop a modern, accessible, and responsive web presence for an interactive museum called the "Community Science Museum". The target audience is primary and middle school children and families. The main goal is to excite people enough to come visit the museum. The theme should not be overly childish, but still appeal to children.
